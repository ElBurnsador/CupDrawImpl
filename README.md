__Premier League Fantasy Football Cup Draw__

*Created this small program to generate a cup draw for a fantasy football league that I run. The program can also be used for other competition draws.*

__*Currently the program only generates one round of fixtures, with the aim in the future to have a full draw executed.*__

Pre-requisites to run:

1. Ensure your list of teams are placed in an Excel file with the name of the team in column A and the managers in column B (if there is no manager, please just put N/A in column B)
2. Place the .xlsx file in src/main/resources folder.
3. Output of the draw will appear in the console (try and create some sort of output for the draw in the future).

TO-DO LIST:

1. Program full draw rather than one round.
2. Program output file of draw .
